GENERATIVE AI
Task Number-1: Text Generation with GPT-2
This project demonstrates how to generate human-like text using OpenAI's GPT-2 language model. GPT-2 is a transformer-based deep learning model trained on a large corpus of text data, capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant text given a prompt.

Repository Features
The repository includes:

Setup and installation instructions for the transformers library.
Preprocessing and tokenization of input text.
Text generation scripts using different decoding strategies (e.g., greedy search, top-k sampling, top-p nucleus sampling).
Optional fine-tuning on custom datasets for domain-specific text generation.
Example outputs showcasing GPT-2's ability to generate stories, articles, and conversations.
Use Cases
Creative writing and story generation
Chatbots and conversational AI
Code or documentation generation
Content assistance tools
Purpose
This project is ideal for exploring how large language models can be applied to real-world text generation tasks using Python and the Hugging Face transformers library.

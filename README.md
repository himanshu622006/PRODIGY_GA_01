# Task Number-1: Text Generation with GPT-2

This project demonstrates how to generate human-like text using OpenAI's GPT-2 language model. GPT-2 is a transformer-based deep learning model trained on a large corpus of text data, capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant text given a prompt.

## Repository Features

The repository includes:

1. Setup and installation instructions for the `transformers` library.
2. Preprocessing and tokenization of input text.
3. Text generation scripts using different decoding strategies (e.g., greedy search, top-k sampling, top-p nucleus sampling).
4. Optional fine-tuning on custom datasets for domain-specific text generation.
5. Example outputs showcasing GPT-2's ability to generate stories, articles, and conversations.

## Use Cases

- Creative writing and story generation  
- Chatbots and conversational AI  
- Code or documentation generation  
- Content assistance tools

## Purpose

This project is ideal for exploring how large language models can be applied to real-world text generation tasks using Python and the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
